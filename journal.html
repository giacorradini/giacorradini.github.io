    <p>the hero's journey</p>

    <section>21.03.2025</section> 

   <p>There comes a time when people like me, who have always led a peaceful and happy life, come in contact with all the misery in the world.</p>
   <p>For me this happened last week, and I can say today that I am no longer the same person, that I no longer see the world as I did before.</p>
   <p>I have been trying for days to make sense of what is happening to me, to find rational explanations in psychology, in how the brain works, etc. There are no rational explanations, that is, there are, but it doesn't matter. The world, people, know how to be horrible people and always have been.</p>
   <p>What place do we good people have in a mean and corrupt world? In my precepts is to pursue science, knowledge and good and to oppose all that is evil and against the growth of the human spirit. But what can I do against such great evil, against such a rotten world.</p>
   <p>The pain is just too much and I know why. Our emotional part, our limbic system, does not respond to the cerebral cortex. When basic needs of the individual, safety, love, are at stake, little can our rational part against pain.</p>
   <p>There is nothing new in this. Ulysses imprisoned by the sorceress Circe. Jesus nailed to the cross. Life is suffering, that's what the Christian message has been carrying for 2.000 years. The world is mean and corrupt, the hero's journey must go on.</p>
