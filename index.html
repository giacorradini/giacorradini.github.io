      <h2>About Me</h2>
    
      <p>My name is Gianmarco Corradini. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics and currently work in Frankfurt in the field of accounting. This website serves as a platform to share my projects and insights related to economics, finance, and computational methods.</p>
      <p>Some of the material here is inspired by work I was commissioned to do as a freelance consultant, reflecting real-world applications and experiences.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Archive</strong> section contains technical works and detailed projects, while the <strong>Journal</strong> section features articles written in a more narrative style, drawing from my travels and personal reflections.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore my work!</p>
