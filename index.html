  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Gianmarco Corradini</strong>, and I’m passionate about the intersection of 
    <em>economics, statistics, and programming</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy working with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>NumPy</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, and 
    <strong>Mathematica</strong> to explore models in macroeconomics, dynamic systems, and computational economics. 
    I'm particularly interested in how mathematical and programming tools can help describe and simulate complex systems — 
    especially in the context of growth and policy modeling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the projects published here are based on <em>freelance assignments</em>, which I’ve extended and refined into 
    general tools or explorations. This site is where I collect those results, along with academic and personal work in 
    data analysis and automation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy solving problems with logic and structure, and I’m always looking to deepen my understanding through hands-on 
    experimentation — especially where economics and code meet.
  </p>
