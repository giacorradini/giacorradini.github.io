    Hi, 
    
    I am Gianmarco and I work as an accountant and tax consultant in Frankfurt.
    I come from Rome, where I earned a master's degree in economics and started my career.
    Economics and finance are my passion and on this site, as well as some of my freelance work, you can find my personal projects and worldview.
    
    Greetings
    
    </p>
