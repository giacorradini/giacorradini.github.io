    <h1>Quasi-Hyperbolic Utility Function in Dynamic General Equilibrium Models</h1>
    <h2>Gianmarco Corradini, 2019</h2>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>This thesis investigates the implications of non-rational consumer behavior in dynamic general equilibrium models, focusing on the use of quasi-hyperbolic utility functions. Empirical research has shown that consumers often display time-inconsistent preferences, favoring immediate rewards over future gains. I examine whether such preferences can be integrated into standard growth models and what macroeconomic effects they produce.</p>
    <p>Two classical frameworks are considered: the Ramsey model and the Overlapping Generations (OLG) model. In the Ramsey model, quasi-hyperbolic preferences have no significant effect on steady-state outcomes. However, in the OLG model, three versions are explored: a benchmark, a multiple-selves approach, and a pre-commitment strategy (Dhami, 2019). These represent varying degrees of rationality in individual decision-making.</p>
    <p>The findings show that deviations from rational behavior distort macroeconomic outcomes in different ways. The greater the degree of irrationality, the further the economy deviates from traditional model predictions. A comparative static analysis, supported by Taylor approximations and numerical simulations (via Wolfram Mathematica), confirms that increased impatience reduces both growth and the speed of convergence to equilibrium.</p>
    <p>Further simulations explore temporary vs. permanent increases in the exogenous growth rate, interpreted as one-off innovations or sustained technological progress. The results confirm: greater consumer rationality leads to faster and more stable convergence.</p>
    <p>Overall, the study demonstrates that even small deviations from full rationality can have measurable effects on long-run growth and macroeconomic dynamics.</p>
